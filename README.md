# sig_classification_project

**Task & Expectations:**
Attached is a training dataset and corresponding label file for a classification problem.
Your task is to propose a solution approach, documenting the steps, ideas, observations, data
analysis, and feature engineering (if any). There’s no need to code the solution, but feel free to
provide as much detail as you'd like.
Please include the success criteria and performance metrics you would use for model
evaluation, along with the reasoning behind your choices. All decisions should be supported by
data observations or sound reasoning.
We will assess the quality of your response based on the submitted document (Word or
PowerPoint). Feel free to share other support documents like notebooks, excels etc. which can
give us more confidence around the work done
